# Enhancing Classification Performance with Clustering: IPL Data Analysis

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks focusing on enhancing classification performance using IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match data. By leveraging clustering techniques as a preprocessing step, the objective is to improve the accuracy of classification models in predicting match outcomes.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. IPL Data Preparation for Analysis
- **Objective:** Thorough preparation of IPL cricket match data for analysis and classification.
- **Key Data Preparation Steps:**
  - Loading IPL match data from CSV files into DataFrames.
  - Cleaning the data by dropping unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
  - Extracting relevant features such as total runs, balls remaining, and wickets remaining.
  - Filtering out irrelevant matches, including abandoned matches and those with super overs.
  - Preparing the dataset for further analysis by excluding unwanted columns and deriving new features.
