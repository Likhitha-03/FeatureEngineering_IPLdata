# IPL Match Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of cricket match data. The main tasks include loading the data from a CSV file, cleaning it, processing date information, calculating total runs, and deriving target values for matches. The steps taken ensure accurate data processing and meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Project Steps

### 1. Loading the Data

- **Step**: Load cricket match data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
- **Objective**: Ensure accurate data type inference for proper data analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- **Step**: Clean the DataFrame by dropping unnecessary columns.
- **Objective**: Remove irrelevant data to streamline the dataset and improve analysis efficiency.

### 3. Date Processing

- **Step**: Process date information to extract the year as the 'season'.
- **Objective**: Create a new 'season' column to categorize matches by year, aiding in temporal analysis.

### 4. Calculating Total Runs

- **Step**: Calculate total runs for each ball and add a new column named 'total'.
- **Objective**: Aggregate run data to analyze the scoring patterns and performance across matches.

### 5. Deriving Targets

- **Step**: Derive targets for each match from the total runs of the first innings.
- **Objective**: Identify the target score for the second innings, crucial for match outcome analysis.

### 6. Updating the DataFrame

- **Step**: Add and update a column 'Targets' with the derived target values.
- **Objective**: Incorporate the target values into the dataset to enable comprehensive match analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Pandas library

2. **Steps to Execute**:
   - Ensure the CSV file containing the cricket match data is in the working directory.
   - Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Drop unnecessary columns.
   - Process date information to extract the year.
   - Calculate total runs for each ball.
   - Derive and add target values for each match.

3. **Sample Code**:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('cricket_match_data.csv')

# Drop unnecessary columns
columns_to_drop = ['unnecessary_column1', 'unnecessary_column2']
df = df.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)

# Process date information
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df['season'] = df['date'].dt.year

# Calculate total runs
df['total'] = df['runs_off_bat'] + df['extras']

# Derive targets
df['Targets'] = df.groupby('match_id')['total'].transform(lambda x: x.cumsum().shift(-1).iloc[0])

# Save the cleaned DataFrame
df.to_csv('cleaned_cricket_match_data.csv', index=False)
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a structured approach to analyzing cricket match data. By following the outlined steps, one can clean the data, process essential information, and derive meaningful insights, such as target scores, to facilitate a deeper understanding of match dynamics.
