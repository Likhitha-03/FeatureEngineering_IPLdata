## Enhanced Data Processing and Dynamic Feature Generation for IPL data Analysis

## Overview

This notebook analyzes cricket match data to derive insights into match outcomes and progress. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced calculations to prepare the data for detailed analysis.

## Contents

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Loaded and cleaned cricket match data from a CSV file.
   - Processed date information to extract season years and cleaned unnecessary columns.
   - Integrated match winner information and removed data from abandoned matches and super overs.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Calculated total runs for each ball and derived targets for matches.
   - Created new columns for runs to be scored, remaining balls, remaining wickets, and match outcome comparison.

3. **Analysis and Insights**
   - Utilized cumulative sum calculations and conditional logic to determine remaining balls and wickets dynamically.
   - Prepared the dataset for detailed analysis of match progress and outcomes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install pandas numpy`).
2. Run the notebook `cricket_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Follow step-by-step execution to understand data cleaning, feature engineering, and analysis processes.
4. Modify as needed for specific cricket match datasets or additional analysis requirements.
